In addition to limiting the amount of money and time spent on video games, China's new rules also include a ban on certain online game content. This has raised concerns among game publishers and developers, as they may need to make significant changes to their games to comply with the regulations. The requirement for game publishers to house their servers in China adds another layer of complexity and cost to the industry. These restrictions and bans are likely to have a substantial impact on the gaming content available to Chinese players and may influence the global gaming market as well.
