# Why JavaScript and Ad Blockers Matter

JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic content on websites. Many modern websites, including reuters.com, rely on JavaScript to deliver a seamless user experience. Ad blockers, on the other hand, are browser extensions or software that prevent advertisements from being displayed on web pages. While ad blockers can enhance browsing experience by reducing clutter and distractions, some websites require users to disable ad blockers to access their content. Understanding the role of JavaScript and ad blockers is crucial for accessing the full range of content on reuters.com.
