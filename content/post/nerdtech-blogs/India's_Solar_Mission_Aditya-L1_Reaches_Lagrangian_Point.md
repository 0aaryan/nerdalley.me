# Aditya-L1 Mission Overview

India's Aditya-L1 solar mission, launched on September 2, is a significant endeavor by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to study the Sun's outermost layer and the corona. The spacecraft is set to reach the Lagrangian point (L1) on January 6, marking a major milestone in India's space exploration efforts. Aditya-L1 aims to observe the Sun from a halo orbit at L1, allowing it to capture valuable data on solar activities, solar winds, and other phenomena. This mission holds immense potential for advancing our understanding of solar behavior and its impact on Earth.
