# The Modus Operandi of Aaron Johnson

Aaron Johnson, the notorious iPhone thief, targeted inebriated men in bars, gained their trust, and asked for their phone passcodes under false pretenses. Once he had the passcodes, he stole the iPhones, changed the Apple ID password, and enrolled his own face in Face ID to gain access to sensitive data and initiate transfers of large sums of money from bank apps. After his criminal activities, he would erase the data and sell the devices to an accomplice.
