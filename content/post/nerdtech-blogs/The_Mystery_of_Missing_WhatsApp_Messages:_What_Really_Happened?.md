The recent revelation by government minister Penny Mordaunt about the disappearance of two years' worth of WhatsApp messages with Boris Johnson has sparked widespread concern and speculation. WhatsApp messages are typically stored separately on each user's device, making it highly unusual for them to simply vanish. This has raised questions about the security and integrity of digital communication, especially within the context of government officials and sensitive information.
