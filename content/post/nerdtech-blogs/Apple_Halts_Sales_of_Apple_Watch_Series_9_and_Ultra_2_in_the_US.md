# Apple's Response to the Ruling

In response to the ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission, Apple has decided to temporarily discontinue the sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the US. The company plans to challenge the decision, expressing concern about the potential impact on users relying on the watches' safety and health features. This move follows allegations by Masimo, claiming that Apple utilized blood-oxygen tracking technology infringing on its patents.

The legal battle between Apple and Masimo began with a complaint filed by Masimo in 2021, alleging that Apple's blood oxygen feature infringed on its patents. The U.S. International Trade Commission issued orders in October to prohibit Apple from importing and selling watches incorporating the blood oxygen feature. In response, Apple has accused Masimo of patent infringement. This ongoing legal dispute has led to the temporary discontinuation of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models in the US.

The removal of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models from Apple's website and retail stores in the US is expected to have an impact on Apple's sales and market share. The wearables, home, and accessories segment accounted for over $9 billion in the last quarter, comprising approximately 10% of total net sales. With the discontinuation of these popular Apple Watch models, the company may experience a decline in sales within this segment.

# Availability Outside the US

While the Series 9 and Ultra 2 models will no longer be available for purchase in the US, they will still be available for purchase outside the country. Additionally, the ITC's order won't impact previously purchased Apple Watches, ensuring that users who already own these models can continue to use them without any restrictions. However, the discontinuation of these models in the US may lead to increased demand for the remaining Apple Watch SE.
