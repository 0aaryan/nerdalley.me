# The Patent Dispute

The patent dispute between Apple and Masimo revolves around the blood oxygen monitoring technology used in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2. Masimo claims that Apple infringed on its patents related to this technology, leading to the US International Trade Commission ordering Apple to stop selling the watches in question in the US. This has resulted in Apple voluntarily removing the watches from its website and planning to cease sales in retail stores starting December 24.
