One of the primary concerns surrounding autonomous trucks is the issue of safety. While proponents argue that driverless technology has the potential to reduce human error and improve road safety, critics point to the need for further testing and development to ensure the reliability and safety of autonomous trucks. Additionally, the industry faces challenges related to regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, and public acceptance, all of which play a crucial role in the successful integration of autonomous trucks into the transportation sector.

The potential impact of autonomous trucks on jobs has been a major point of concern for labor unions and industry workers. The vetoed law, which aimed to ban self-driving trucks without a human onboard, was backed by unions who argued that autonomous trucks pose a threat to jobs in the trucking industry. As the technology continues to advance, the implications for employment and the role of labor unions in shaping the future of autonomous trucking remain a critical aspect of the ongoing debate.
