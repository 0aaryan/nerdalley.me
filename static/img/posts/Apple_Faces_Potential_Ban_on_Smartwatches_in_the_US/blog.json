            "content": "The ban, set to take effect on Christmas, could have a substantial impact on Apple's $17 billion smartwatch business. If the ban holds, Apple will need to stop selling the prohibited watches, leading to a potential loss of revenue. Moreover, the company may need to make hardware changes, which could take several months to implement. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and affect its overall financial performance."

            "content": "It's important to note that the impact of the potential ban is limited to Apple's direct sales channels. Third-party retailers can continue offering the device, which means that consumers may still have access to Apple's smartwatches through alternative channels. While this may mitigate some of the impact, it underscores the significance of resolving the patent dispute to ensure uninterrupted availability of the product."
